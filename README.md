CS251 Project03- Password Cracking
My program should not have any special operating conditions. On rare occasion, it would not find the correct password, but this was fixed by changing the for loop in brute to iterate 31 times instead of 32. There were no special conditions, and my program cracked the correct passwords for brute 4-6 and symbol table 4-10. I did not run symbol table for 12 characters, although I am sure it will takemuch longer than symbol table 8.
Given a table of binary values and the associated ASCII representation, crack a password using a symbol table and by brute force.
